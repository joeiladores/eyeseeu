        <img class="content-images img-fluid pt-3 pb-3" src="photo/services/services-comprehensive-eye-exam.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Bypass the wait at your family physician's office! All of our doctors are trained and licensed to diagnose and prescribe medications to treat all ocular and vision problems. There is no need to go to a family doctor's office if you are having vision changes or any eye condition such as an infection, itching, redness, eye pain, etc.. All of these ocular conditions can and should be addressed by a doctor of optometry. Our doctors take care of every aspect of your eye health and vision needs.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Complete assessments allow for early intervention Many ocular conditions, including some sight threatening ones, initially present without any symptoms but can be detected through routine, annual, comprehensive eye exams. Early diagnosis and treatment can be the difference between sight for life and a visual impairment. Should we find any irregularity during your check-up, we will make sure you understand its nature and severity, and the options you have to address it.</p>
        <p>Your routine annual assessment includes:
          <ul>
            <li>A complete general & oculo-visual health history of patient & their related family</li>
            <li>A vision assessment</li>
            <li>Determination of the most accurate prescription for far, near, and work-station viewing</li>

        <h2>Adult Eye Exams</h2>
        <img class="content-images img-fluid pt-3 pb-3" src="photo/services/services-adult-eye-exam.jpg" alt="">
        <p>We will evaluate your vision ( and possible need for glasses and / or contact lenses ) as well as your eye health. Our examination includes assessment for conditions such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and retinal detachment. Some patients will need to have their pupils dilated to allow for better assessment of these conditions.</p>
        <p>The Philippine Association of Optometrists recommends that adults ( 20-64 years ) have their eyes examined every one to two years. Older adults ( 65 years and older ) should have their eyes examined annually. Some adults may need to have their eyes examined more frequently than this depending on their health, risk factors and medications they take ( e.g. diabetes, family history of glaucoma, etc ). After your initial exam, we can advise you how often you should have your eyes checked based on YOUR particular eye care needs.</p>

      <div class="content-items pb-5" id="children-eye-exam">
        <h2>Children Eye Exam</h2>
        <img class="content-images img-fluid pt-3 pb-3" src="photo/services/services-child-eye-exam.jpg" alt="">
        <p>It is important for children to have their eyes examined starting at a young age. The Philippine Association of Optometrists recommends that children have their first eye exam at the age of six ( 6 )months. This may seem young, but it is important to ensure normal ocular health and eye coordination as your young child’s vision is developing. We can assess your child’s ocular health and visual skills such as near vision, distance vision, depth perception, eye movement, peripheral awareness and color vision. Good vision is more than just seeing 20/20!</p>
        <p>The Philippine Association of Optometrists recommends the following frequency of eye exams for children:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Infants and toddlers ( birth to 24 months )- by age 6 months</li>
          <li>Preschool ( 2 to 5 years )- at age 3, and prior to entering elementary school</li>
          <li>School age ( 6 to 19 years )-annually</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some children have a higher risk of having visual problems, and therefore, may need to be seen more frequently. Some of the factors which may indicate high risk includes premature birth, low birth weight, family history of strabismus ( eye turn ) or amblyopia ( lazy eye ), children with reading and/or learning disabilities.</p>

      <div class="content-items pb-5" id="senior-eye-exam">
        <h2>Senior Eye Exam</h2>
        <img class="content-images img-fluid pt-3 pb-3" src="photo/services/services-senior-eye-exam.jpg" alt="">
        <p>By approximately age 60 there is an increased risk of developing cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and other eye diseases. This is particularly true in those with family histories, certain nationalities/ethnic groups, and certain lifestyles/habits. Many eye diseases have no symptoms in their early stages and if detected early, intervention will help reduce the risk of permanent vision loss.</p>
        <p>ESU Optical covers the basic components of a comprehensive eye exam annually for seniors aged 65 and older. Our doctors recommend additional retinal assessments annually for all patients, especially those over the age of 60. This allows for earlier detection of retinal disease in this higher risk group.</p>
